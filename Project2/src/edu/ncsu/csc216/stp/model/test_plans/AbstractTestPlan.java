 * Abstract class which is used to create the two types of test plans, normal

 * using inheritance to simplify data storing and accessing, since the two types
 * of Test Plans share a marginal amount of data and construction. This class is
 * abstract because it will never actually be instantiated, but rather, used to
 * shorten the amount of work to create the two types of Test Plans.
